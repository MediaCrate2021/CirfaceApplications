    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <p>By using Custom Field Exporter ("the App"), you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
    <p>The App is a read-only governance tool that connects to your Asana workspace via Asana's official OAuth API. It retrieves custom field definitions and related metadata and displays them in a searchable, exportable format. The App does not modify any data in your Asana workspace.</p>

    <h2>2. Asana Account Required</h2>
    <p>To use the App, you must have a valid Asana account with access to at least one workspace. By connecting your account, you authorize the App to access your workspace data using the read-only permissions you grant during the OAuth authorization flow.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App only for its intended purpose of viewing and exporting custom field governance data</li>
      <li>Only connect Asana accounts that you are authorized to access</li>
      <li>Not attempt to circumvent, disable, or interfere with the App's security features</li>
      <li>Not use the App to collect data from workspaces you do not have legitimate access to</li>
      <li>Comply with Asana's own <a href="https://asana.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a> when using data obtained through the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we handle your information. In summary: we do not store your data, we do not share it with third parties, and you can revoke access at any time.</p>

    <h2>5. Exported Data</h2>
    <p>CSV exports generated by the App may contain workspace data including custom field names, configurations, project names, and user names. You are responsible for handling exported data in accordance with your organization's data governance policies and any applicable regulations.</p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App will be available at all times or free from errors</li>
      <li>The data displayed will be complete or perfectly accurate (the App depends on Asana's API, which may have its own limitations)</li>
      <li>The App will meet all of your specific requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App's developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption.</p>

    <h2>8. API Limitations</h2>
    <p>The App relies on Asana's API, which has its own rate limits, access restrictions, and data availability constraints. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Private projects you are not a member of will not appear in results</li>
      <li>"Last Used" dates are approximate and based on task modification timestamps</li>
      <li>Some features may require an Asana Premium, Business, or Enterprise plan</li>
      <li>Asana may change their API at any time, which could affect the App's functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Revocation</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time. To fully disconnect, visit your <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asana App Settings</a> and revoke the App's access. No data will remain after disconnection, as the App does not store any data.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact the App administrator.</p>
